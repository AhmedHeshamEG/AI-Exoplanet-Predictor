## üìñ About

This is a Machine Learning Model that can predict the probability of a star to host an Exoplanet.

We believe that this method is gonna be very useful to the Researchers working on the next space Missions such as **Roman Telescope**, **Plato**, also future ones like **Ariel** and **HWO**.

## ü§î How??

Simply, if the telescope detects 2 Billion Stars and starts to work on them to discover Exoplanets, **Which one is gonna be the first One??**

This is where our Implementation excels, it's using **Isolation Forest** (ML Algorithm) trained on the Confirmed Stars hosting Exoplanets.

## üí° Impact

This Model is going to reduce, **so much**, the amount of Resources, time, research and Money spent on Observations for years and at the end not getting outcomes.
